Entity FrameWork In MVC :- An ORM Framework : 
application(Types(Classes)) <--> {ORM} <--> (Database)

1.Entity Framework is an ORM FrameWork that asp.net MVC application can use.
2.EDM(Entity Data Model) : it is a conceptual model that describes the entites(tables) and the associations they participate in an application.
3.EDM is a set of concepts that describe the structure data.
4.EDM is a model that describes entities and the relationships between them.
5.EDM allows you to handle data access logic by programming against entities without having to worry about the structure of the underlying data store and how to connect with it.
6.Entity FrameWork eliminates the need to write most of the data-access code that otherwise need to be written.
7.It is an enhancement to ADO.Net that gives developers an automated mechanism for accessing and storing the data in the database.
8.Using Entity FrameWork, developers issue queries using LINQ(Language integrated Queries),then retrive and manipulate data as strongly type objects.
There are 3 types of Approaches in Entity Framework

1.Code First Approach - > In the code first approach the entity framework creates database object based on model classes that we can create to represent application data.
2.Is the most common approach implemented in asp.net MVC framework.
3.Allows you to develope your application by coding model classes and properties and delegates the process of creating the database objects to the Entity FrameWork.

3.The Code First approach allows us to define your own model by creating custom classes.

4.Then we can create database based on the Models.

//Step 1 : -Create Model Class : it is a blueprint of Database table.
 public class Visitors
 {
     [Key]
     public int Id { get; set; } // Primary Key

     [Required]
     public string Name { get; set; }

     [Required, EmailAddress]
     public string Email { get; set; }

     [Required]
     public string Message { get; set; }

     [Required]
     public DateTime DateOfVisit { get; set; }
 }



//Step 2:-Create Connection String
 <connectionStrings>
   <add name="MyConnection" connectionString="Server=DESKTOP-MPE7G61;Database=Visitors;Trusted_Connection=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
 </connectionStrings>


//Step 3: - In Step 2 we have to use DbContext class.it is a heart of of the Entity Framework.this class maps the database table and handles the CRUD OPeration.
Create DbContext Class

public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public AppDbContext() : base("name=MyConnection") { }
    DbSet<Visitors> visitors { get; set; }
}

//Step 4 :Enable Migration(Package Console Manager)
Enable-Migration

//Step 5: Creation Migration
Add-Migration

//Step 6:- Update-Database







2.Database First Approach
3.Model First Approach
