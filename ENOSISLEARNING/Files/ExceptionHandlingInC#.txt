//C# Exception and it's Types: An exception(Error,Bug) is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution.

C# Exception Hierarchy
Object----->Exception
The major two exception classes derived from the Exception Class.
1.SystemException - Built-in exception : all the  Built-in exception classes are derived from SystemEsception class.This calss handles all thw system-related exceptions.
Some common system related exceptions:
1.Stackoverflow : this exception is thrown when the execution stack exceds the stack size.
2.ArithmeticException : this exception is thrown for errors in arithmetic,casting or Conversion.
	*DividedByZeroException
3.ValidationException : this exception is thrown when an input value is not valid.
4.ArgumentException : this exception is thrown when we provide one invalid argument in a method.
 class Program
 {       
     public static void Main(string[] args)
     {
         int[] num = { 1,2,3};
         //print the array element present at 4th index
         Console.WriteLine(num[4]);//System Exception
     }
 }


2.ApplicationException - Userdefined exception : We can also create user-defined exceptions which ar know as Application level exception.The ApplicationException class is a base class from which we can derived application level exceptins.




C# Exception Handling : Exceptions abnormally terminate the flow of the program instructions,w need to handle those exceptions.Responding and handle excptions is called Exception Handling.

try and catch block :  the try and catch block is used to handle exceptions in C#.
Synatx:
try
{

	//code that may be raise an error

}
catch(Exception ex)
{

	//code that handles the error
}


 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     try
     {
         int num = 0;
         //code that may raise an error
         int dividebyZero = 7 / num;
         Console.WriteLine(dividebyZero);
     }
     catch (Exception ex)
     {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
     }
 }


try catch and finally block
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
         Console.WriteLine("Enter First no:-");
         int fn = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
         Console.WriteLine("Enter Second no:-");
         int sn = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
     try
     {
         int result = fn / sn;
         Console.WriteLine("Division of two values is :-"+result);
     }
     catch (Exception ex)
     {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
     }
     finally
     {
         //this code is always execute whether of exception occured or not.
         Console.WriteLine("Sum of Two Two values is :-"+(fn+sn));
     }
 }
