Razor View Syntax: View Provides the UI of the application to the user. is uses to display content of an application and also to accept user input.use modeldata to create this ui. contains both HTML markup and c# code that runs on the web server.view has a file extension .cshtml

 Razor:  is a syntax based on the asp.net framework that allows creating views. is simple and easy to understand for users who are fimiliar with the c#.net or vb.net programming language.

Razor Engine:  The MVC freamework uses a view engine to convert the code of a view into html markup that a browser can understand. is used as the default view engine by the MVC framework.compiles a view of your application when the view is required for the first time.Delivers the compiled view for subsequent request untill you make changes to the view.does not introduce a new set of programming language , but provides template markup syntax to segregate HTML markup and programming code in a view.
