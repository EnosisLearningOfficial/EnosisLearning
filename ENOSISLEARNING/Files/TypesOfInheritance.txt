C++ Public : public inheritance makes public members of the base class public in the derived class, and the protected members of the base class remain protected in the derived class.
Protected : protected inheritance makes the public and protected members of the base class protected in the derived class.
Private Inheritance : private inheritance makes the public and protected members of the base class private in the derived class.

*private members of the base class are inaccessible to the derived class.


Types of Inheritance : 
1.Single Inheritance - A derived class inherits from one base class.Simple and most common form of inheritance.

class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class B : public A
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;


}

2. Multiple Inheritance - A derived class inherits from more than one base class.C++ supports this directly.


class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class B
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class C : public A, public B
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;


}

3. Multilevel Inheritance : 

class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class B : public class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class C : public B
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;


}
class D : public C
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;


}

4. Hierarchical Inheritance : Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class B : public class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class C : public A
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;


}
class D : public A
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;

}

5. Hybrid (or Virtual) Inheritance - A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class B : public class A
{

public string Name;
public int Id;


}

class C : public A
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;


}
class D : public C
{

public string Email;
public int Roll;

}
