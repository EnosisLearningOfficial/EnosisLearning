in C# classes and objects are the core building block of object oriented programming..
A class provides a way to model real-world entities by grouping data and behaviour together.
while objects represent the actual entity created from these class.

class : it is a user defined type. that encaptulate data and behaviour.it contain fields,properties,methods and Constructor.

Constructor:it is a special method in a class.that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.it has same name as the class.it does not have any return type but however a constructor can take parameters.and it is mainly used to initialize the object's data members.

There are some types of Constructor:
1.Default Constructor : a default constructor in c# is a constructor with no parameneters.it is automatically provided  by the compiler if no constructor in the class.it initialize numeric filds to 0.

 //Default Constructor//
 public Student()
 {
     Console.WriteLine("Enter Id:-");
     Id = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
     Console.WriteLine("Enter Name");
     Name = Console.ReadLine();
     Console.WriteLine("Enter Age:-");
     Age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
     Console.WriteLine("Enter Address:-");
     Address = Console.ReadLine();
 }


2.Parameterized Constructor: a constructor having at least one parameter is called a parameterized constructor.it can initiliz each instanceof the class to different values.
  //Parameterized Constructor
 public Student(int id, string name, int age,string add)
 {
     Id = id;
     Name = name;
     Age = age;
     Address = add;
 }

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Student s1 = new Student();
    Student s2 = new Student(2,"B",13,"B");
    s1.ShowData();
    s2.ShowData();
    
}

3.Copy Constructor : a copy constructor is used to create a new object by copying the values from an existing object of the same class.usdeful when we need to duplicate an object or create a new object based on the state of another.
 public Student(Student s)
 {
     Id = s.Id;
     Name = s.Name;
     Age = s.Age;
     Address = s.Address;
 }

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Student s1 = new Student();
    Student s2 = new Student(2,"B",13,"B");
    Student s3 = new Student(s1);
    s1.ShowData();
    s2.ShowData();
    s3.ShowData();

}

//HomeWork
4.Private Constructor
5.Static Constructor


2.Destructor : it is also a member method in a class.and it is called when an onject is going to destroye.destructor have same name as the class with the sign of tilde(~).

 //Destructor
 ~Student()
 {
     Console.WriteLine("Destructor Called");
 }
