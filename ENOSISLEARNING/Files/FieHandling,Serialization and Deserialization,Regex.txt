C# Files : C# provides the File class which is used to perform various operations like creating a file, opening a file, reading and writing a file etc.
What are Files and Directory ?
A file is a named location that can be used to store related information. For example,

program.cs is a C# file that contains information about the C# program.

A directory is a collection of files and subdirectories. A directory inside a directory is known as a subdirectory.

C# provides a System.IO namespace that contains several classes that are used to perform operations on files and dictionaries.

1.Create a File in C#
We use the Create() method of the File class to create a new file in C#.
The "@" in front of "C:\Program\myFile.txt" indicates this as a verbatim string. We use verbatim string to tell the compiler to ignore escape character \.


public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //path of the file that we want to create
    string pathName = @"F:\Abhijet_Roy\MyFile\MyTextFile.txt";
    //create a file 
    FileStream fs = File.Create(pathName);
    //check if file is cfeated or not
    if (File.Exists(pathName))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("File created successfully at " + pathName);
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("File creation failed");
    }
}
2.Open a File
We use the Open() method of the File class to open an existing file in C#. The method opens a FileStream on the specified file. 
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //path of the file that we want to create
    string pathName = @"F:\Abhijet_Roy\MyFile\MyTextFile.txt";
    //open a file 
    FileStream fs = File.Open(pathName,FileMode.Open);
}
3.Write to a File
We use the WriteAllText() method of the File class to write to a file. The method creates a new file and writes content to that file.
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     //path of the file that we want to create
     string pathName = @"F:\Abhijet_Roy\MyFile\MyTextFile.txt";
     //write a file 
     File.WriteAllText(pathName, "Hello World! This is my first text file.");
 }

4.Read a File in C#
We use the ReadAllText() method of the File class to read contents of the file. The method returns a string containing all the text in the specified file.

 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     //path of the file that we want to create
     string pathName = @"F:\Abhijet_Roy\MyFile\MyTextFile.txt";
     //read a file 
    string readTxt = File.ReadAllText(pathName);
     Console.WriteLine(readTxt);
 }

Serialization in C# is the process of converting an object's state into a format that can be stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. The inverse process, converting the serialized format back into an object, is called deserialization. 

using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text.Json; // Requires .NET Core 3.0+ or .NET 5+

// Define your class
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Course { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an object
        Student student = new Student
        {
            Id = 101,
            Name = "Abhijeet Roy",
            Course = "Full Stack .NET"
        };

        // Convert object to JSON
        string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(student);

        // Write to file
        File.WriteAllText("student.json", jsonString);

        Console.WriteLine("Object saved successfully!");

        // Read back from file (optional)
        string readData = File.ReadAllText("student.json");
        Student loadedStudent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Student>(readData);

        Console.WriteLine($"Loaded Student: {loadedStudent.Name}, {loadedStudent.Course}");
    }
}

Regex In C# : Regular Expressions (Regex) are used to search, match, and manipulate text using specific patterns.
C# provides the System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace for this.

 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     string input = "Email@gmail.com";
     string patternMobile = @"\b\d{10}\b"; // 10-digit numbers
     string pattern = @"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b";
     string inputMobile = "6543210";

     bool isMatch = Regex.IsMatch(input, pattern);
     bool isMatch2 = Regex.IsMatch(inputMobile, patternMobile);
     Console.WriteLine(isMatch ? "valid Email" : "Invalid email");
     Console.WriteLine(isMatch2 ? "valid Mobile" : "Invalid Mobile");

     //Replace Text
     string text = "I love C#. C# is powerful.";
     string replaced = Regex.Replace(text, "C#", "JAVA");
     Console.WriteLine(replaced);
 }
