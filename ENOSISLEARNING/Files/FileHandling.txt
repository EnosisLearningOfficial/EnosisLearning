C# Files : C# provides the File class which is used to perform various operations like creating a file, opening a file, reading and writing a file etc.
What are Files and Directory ?
A file is a named location that can be used to store related information. For example,

program.cs is a C# file that contains information about the C# program.

A directory is a collection of files and subdirectories. A directory inside a directory is known as a subdirectory.

Working with Files in C# :C# provides a System.IO namespace that contains several classes that are used to perform operations on files and dictionaries.

1.Create()	Create or overwrite a file in the specified path.
2.Open()	Opens a FileStream on the specified path with read / write access
3.WriteAllText()	Create a new file, writes the specified string to the file, and then closes the file
4.ReadAllText()	Opens a text file, reads all lines of the file, and then closes the file.
5.Copy()	Copies an existing file to a new file. Overwriting a file of the same name is not allowed.
6.AppendAllText()	Opens a file, appends the specified string to the file, and then closes the file. If the file does not exist, this method creates a file, writes the specified string to the file, then closes the file.


1.Create a File in C# : We use the Create() method of the File class to create a new file in C#.
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     //Path of th file to be created
     string Path = "F:\\Abhijet_Roy\\CsharpTut\\myFile.txt";

     FileStream fs = File.Create(Path);

     //Check if myfile.txt is created at the specified location
     if (File.Exists(Path))
     {
         Console.WriteLine("File created successfully");
     }
     else
     {
         Console.WriteLine("File creation failed.");
     }
 }


In the above example, we have created a file myFile.txt at C:\Program directory using the Create() method.

After creating the file, notice that we have used the Exists() method to check whether the file myFile.txt exists or not.

2.Open a File : We use the Open() method of the File class to open an existing file in C#. The method opens a FileStream on the specified file. 

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Path of th file to be created
            string Path = "F:\\Abhijet_Roy\\CsharpTut\\myFile.txt";

            //open a file at path
            FileStream fs = File.Open(Path,FileMode.Open);
        }


3.Write to a File: We use the WriteAllText() method of the File class to write to a file. The method creates a new file and writes content to that file.

 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     //Path of th file to be created
     string Path = "F:\\Abhijet_Roy\\CsharpTut\\myFile.txt";

     //Write a file at path
     File.WriteAllText(Path,"The text has been written...!");
 }

4.Read a File in C# : We use the ReadAllText() method of the File class to read contents of the file. The method returns a string containing all the text in the specified file.
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Path of th file to be created
    string Path = "F:\\Abhijet_Roy\\CsharpTut\\myFile.txt";
    //Read a file at path
    string Readtext = File.ReadAllText(Path);
    Console.WriteLine(Readtext);
}

5.AppendAllText()
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Path of th file to be created
    string Path = "F:\\Abhijet_Roy\\CsharpTut\\myFile.txt";

    string content = "This is a new line added"+DateTime.Now.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss") + "\n";

    //Append Mode
    File.AppendAllText(Path, content);
    //Read a file at path
    string Readtext = File.ReadAllText(Path);
    Console.WriteLine(Readtext);
}
