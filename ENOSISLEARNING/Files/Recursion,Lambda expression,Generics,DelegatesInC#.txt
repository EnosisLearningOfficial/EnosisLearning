C# Recursion : A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this way is known as recursion.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion
Advantage - Using recursion, our code looks clean and more readable.

Disadvantages - When a recursive call is made, new storage locations for variables are allocated on the stack. As each recursive call returns, the old variables and parameters are removed from the stack. Hence, recursion generally uses more memory and is generally slow.
class Program
{       
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
          int num = factorial(4);
        Console.WriteLine("factorial of given value is :-" +num);
    }
    public static int factorial(int num)
    {
        //terminate condition
        if(num == 0)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            //Recursive call
            return num * factorial(num-1);
        }
    }
}

C# Lambda Expression : C# Lambda Expression is a short block of code that accepts parameters and returns a value. It is defined as an anonymous function (function without a name). 
(parameterList) => lambda Body
parameterList - list of input parameters
=> - a lambda operator
lambda body - can be an expression or statement

Types of Lambda Expression
The two types of lambda expressions are:

1.Expression Lambda : Expression lambda contains a single expression in the lambda body. 
class Program
{       
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //expressing lambda that returns the square of a number
        var square = (int num) => num * num;
        Console.WriteLine("Square of a number is :-"+square(5));
    }
}
2.Statement Lambda : Statement lambda encloses one or more statements in the lambda body. We use curly braces {} to wrap the statements.
class Program
{       
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //statement lambda that takes two values as an input and return the sum
        var sum = (int a, int b) =>
        {
            int result = a + b;
            return result;
        };
        Console.WriteLine("Sum of Given number is :-"+sum(5,10));
    }
}

C# generics : C# Generics allow us to create a single class or method that can be used with different types of data.This helps us to reuse our code.
1.C# generics Class : A generics class is used to create an instance of any data type. To define a generics class, we use angle brackets (<>) 
 //define generic class
 public class Student<T>
 {
     //define a variable of type T
     public T data;

     //constructor to initialize data
     public Student(T value)
     {
         this.data = value;
         Console.WriteLine("Data Passed:-"+this.data);
     }
 }
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     //create object of Student class with string type
     Student<string> s1 = new Student<string>("Hello Generic World");
     Student<int> s2 = new Student<int>(123);

 }

C# generics Method : Similar to the generics class, we can also create a method that can be used with any type of data.

//define generic class
public class Employee<T>
{
    //define a variable of type T
    public T data;

    //constructor to initialize data
    public void Display(T value)
    {
        this.data = value;
        Console.WriteLine("Data Passed:-"+this.data);
    }
}
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //create object of Student class with string type
    Employee<string> s1 = new Employee<string>();
    s1.Display("Hello World");
    Employee<int> s2 = new Employee<int>();
    s2.Display(10);

}

Delegates : In C#, a delegate is a pointer to a method. That means, a delegate holds the address of a method which can be called using that delegate.
Define a delegate : We define a delegate just like we define a normal method. That is, delegate also has a return type and parameter.
syntax: 
public delegate int myDelegate(int x);
delegate - a keyword
int - return type of delegate
myDelegate - delegate name
int x - parameter that the delegate takes
A delegate is also called type-safe pointer.

 class Program
 {
     //define a method that returns sum of teo int numbers
     public static int Calculatesum(int x, int y)
     {
        return x + y;
     }
     //define a deligate
     public delegate int mydelegate(int num1, int num2);
     public static void Main(string[] args)
     {
         //create an instance of delegate by passing method name
         mydelegate d = new mydelegate(Calculatesum);

         //call the delegate
         int result = d(10,20);
         Console.WriteLine(result);
     }
 }

Multicast Delegate in C# : The multicast delegate is used to point to more than one method at a time. We use += operator to add methods to delegate. 

 class Program
 {
     //define a method that returns sum of teo int numbers
     public static int Calculatesum(int x, int y)
     {
        return x + y;
     }
     // method that prints difference of two int numbers 
     public static int difference(int x, int y)
     {
         return x-y;
     }
     //define a deligate
     public delegate int mydelegate(int num1, int num2);
     public static void Main(string[] args)
     {
         //create an instance of delegate by passing method name
         mydelegate d = new mydelegate(Calculatesum);

         //Multicast delegate
         d += difference;

         foreach(Delegate del in d.GetInvocationList())
         {
             int result = (int)del.DynamicInvoke(100,20);
             Console.WriteLine(result);
         }
     }
 }
